    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Even the most novice baker can achieve success with this easy and delicious Cherry Pie recipe. It includes a homemade cherry pie filling made with fresh or canned cherries, baked inside a flaky pie crust. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups fresh, sour cherries</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>Red food coloring</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>homemade pie crust</li>
            <li>1 large egg white, beaten with a fork</li>
            <li>granulated sugar, for sprinkling on top</li>
        </ul>   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grab your 9'' deep dish pie pan. (You can use a regular 9'' pan but you may have more filling than you need).</li>
            <li>Remove one chilled pie crust dough from the fridge. On a lightly floured counter, roll out your dough to about 12'' in diameter. Gently place in the bottom of your 9'' deep dish pie dish. Spoon the cherry filling into the unbaked crust and sprinkle a little cinnamon over the filling.</li>
            <li>Remove the second pie crust from the fridge and roll it out in a similar manner. Use a pizza cutter, knife or pastry wheel to cut the crust into long strips, about 1/2'' wide. Lay strips over the crust in a lattice pattern. (If you're lazy, like me, you can just lay half of the strips going one direction, and the others on top, going perpendicular, leaving a small space between each.)
            <li>Pinch the edges of the top and bottom pie crusts together and crimp the edge, if you like. Brush a thin layer of beaten egg white over the top of the pie crust and sprinkle the crust pieces lightly with granulated sugar.
            <li>Bake at 400 degrees F for 40-45 minutes. Check it after about 25 minutes and gently place a piece of tinfoil over the top crust to keep it from getting too brown. I remove this tinfoil about 5 minutes before it's done baking.</li>
            <li>Remove to a wire cooling rack and allow to cool for several hours. Once cooled completely, you can cut and serve it, or cover it and refrigerate it overnight to serve the next day.</li>
            <li>Leftover cherry pie will last up to 5 days, stored in the fridge.</li>
        </ol>
